# Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

DLT is a general protocol and structure for recording data in a distributed and secure
fashion. It emphasizes the presence of a system that is controlled by a distributed network
and has no central control. DLT secures data through cryptography and distributes them
across the network for storage. This technology is designed to establish trust between
parties that do not trust each other. Multiple copies of each record are kept and are linked
together by a cryptographic algorithm, and all copies of data must be compromised for the
intrusion to be successful.

This technology is divided into different subcategories according to the structure
created to keep the data record. Each of these subcategories includes a wide range of
technologies that have their own advantages and disadvantages.

This article discusses five sub-technologies under the distributed ledger technology:
Blockchain, Tangle, Hashgraph, Side-chains, BlockDAG and Holochain. Each of these technologies
distributes trust between users and records information, but the manner in which they
retain data and the consensus algorithm they use to ensure the accuracy of procedures
are different. In summary, consensus algorithms can be used to make all the nodes in the
network agree on the records they are storing. Due to the differences between consensus
algorithms, each technology has unique features as well as advantages and disadvantages.
